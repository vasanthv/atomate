# Atomate

A minimal, free news reader for the web.

Atomate lets you add news sources, blogs, microblogs, newsletters, YouTube channels, social media accounts, or any site with a **public RSS or Atom** feed and merges them into a single chronological feed.

## Features

- Single chronological feed for all your RSS & Atom feeds.
- Read the contents of the news without leaving the app.
- Ability to add a social feed from Mastodon, Bluesky, Tumblr, YouTube, etc.
- Progressive web app. Installable on mobile phones.
- 100% Free & Open-source.
- Ad-free (_and I wish to stay that way_)

## Prototype

Atomate in its current state is just more than a prototype, I wanted to share this with the community as early as possible to receive feedback. So feel free to drop your comments & feedback as Github issues, which I will monitor closely.
