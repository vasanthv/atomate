# Atomate

A minimal, free news reader for the web.

Atomate lets you add news source, blogs, microblogs, newsletters, Youtube channels, social media accounts or any site with a **public RSS or Atom** feed and merges them into a single chronological feed.

Note: Atomate in it's current state is just more than a prototype, and is currently not looking for any code contributions. So please restrain yourself from contributing any code changes. But, feel free to leave comments & suggestions in Github issues and I will be very happy to consider them.

## Features

- Single chronological feed for all your RSS & Atom feeds.
- Read the contents of the news without leaving the app.
- Ability to add social feed from Mastodon, Bluesky, Tumblr, Youtube etc.
- Progressive web app. Installable on mobile phones.
- 100% Free & Open-source.
- Ad free (_and I wish to stay that way_)
