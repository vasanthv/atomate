## Atomate Contributions

Atomate in it's current state is just more than a prototype, and currently is not looking for any code contributions. So please restrain yourself from contributing any code changes. But, feel free to leave comments & suggestions in Github issues and I will be very happy to consider them as I am actively working on this project.

### Support the Project

If you would like to support Atomate and it's development, consider sponsoring in [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/vasanthv). It helps in the development and maintenance of the application. Your support is always appreciated!
